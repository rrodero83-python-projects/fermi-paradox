### Project 17 - Modeling the Milky Way
**Objective:**
For a given number of advanced galactic civilizations and an average radio bubble
size, estimate the probability of any civilization detecting the radio transmissions of
any other civilization. For perspective, post the size of Earthâ€™s current radio bubble
on a 2D graphical representation of the Milky Way.
